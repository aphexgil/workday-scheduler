# Work Day Scheduler

A simple work-day scheduler widget. The current day is listed at the top of the page, followed by a table with rows for standard working hours. Hours in the past are grey, hours in the future are in green and the current hour is red. In any row, the user may write down a task for that hour. On each row is a save button that, when clicked, saves the content of that row to local storage. On page load, local storage is queried and any previously saved values are loaded and printed to appropirate text areas.
